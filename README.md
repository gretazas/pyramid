# Features

- First feature in this app is printed Welcome message
- First interactive feature in this app is to choose a level. Easy/ Hard
- Then the board is printed along with scores
- Then fallowed by making the move using inputs only if Player chose easy level
     - It is easy, because in this case Player starts and ends the game
     - It gives a chance to earn extra points
- Or Bot randomly choosing position on board if level is hard
    - It is hard because in this case Bot starts and ends the game.
    - Player must predict Bot's last moves in order to earn higher score

# Future feature

In the future i would like to add one more level of difficulty and add bots logic where it could see potentional in scoring more points with certain position moves.

# Testing

I have manually tested this project by doing the fallowing:
- Passed the code through a PEP8 linter and comfirmed there are no problems
- Given invalid inputs: strings when numbers are expected, out of bounds inputs, same input twice
- Tested in my local terminal and the Heroku terminal.
