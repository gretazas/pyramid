[Back to README page](./README.md)

Originally game would look like in the picture at the beginning only when playing on the paper I don't need any letters or numbers.<br>
Those would be indicators for the user to get an idea of where to choose the position.

In the second picture, you can see I point taken. It will be marked that the Player scored one point in the Row. <br>
Originally in the game, I would stroke a line there to mark it is taken.

In the third picture, you can see two lines taken.<br>
Each line would score 3 points.<br>
If the last move ther was C7, the Player gets 6 points in total for one move.

In the last picture, you can see all possible lines scored throughout the game. <br>
There you can peek behind the scene too. You can see all the hidden board where functionality is applied to keep the game going.
